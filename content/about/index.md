My name is Cory  McDonald, I'm a developer in Kansas City, Missouri. I currently work at [Brave](https://brave.com) where I'm the lead engineer of the Creator application. I'm the organizer of the Kansas City [ask-a-dev](https://askadev.org/) group which provides free mentoring to local programmers.
